# Human Resource Analytics: Emory RAS (Research Administration Services) - Employee Turnover

The "quit" dataset (provided in both .sav and .xlsx formats) consists of data about the complete career histories of RAS staff at Emory University. The dataset involves information about 242 unique individual employees (defined by "uid" in the dataset) and 272 unique individual-level spells of employment (defined by "rasid" in the dataset. The data includes 1256 cases (records), including 49 voluntary quits and 8 involuntary quits. (Please see the codebook spreadsheet file for more information about the data columns.)

In this project, after data processing and transformation, mainly survival analysis has been implemented in SPSS, using tools such as Kaplan-Meier survival plots, descriptive statistics such as log-rank statistics, and statistical modeling (Cox Regression) to analyze what explains an employee's quit or stay at certain point of time. Please refer to the project report to get more idea of the analysis, results and interpretations/insights for this project.
